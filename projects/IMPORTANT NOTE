The mod has officially been ported to Mapbase tools, meaning, if you want to mess around with the files, you NEED to have Mapbase installed!
Here's a link for the official Moddb page:

Opening the maps with vanilla hammer WILL cause problems

Another important note, because of the port, this project also requires Slartibarty's Slammin' Source tools, heres a official link for the download:
