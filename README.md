# Source-Mods
This is a repository for the creation of my mods made in the source engine

My main focus of the mods are the maps since i study level design for more than 3 years, i've never finished a project ever, i hope that this could help me finish something and be proud of it, but it's hard when it's just one person doing everything, so i made it open source, for everyone to do whatever they want with my projects, and help me maybe. I could call help from my friends, but they are too stupid to understand the things that i do, so i don't even bother asking them to do...

Fell free to change whatever you want, i will check if everything is okay and then use it on my projects, and, of course, give you credit for helping me with the development. If you don't want to change anything and just want to see/download/play the things that i do, go for it, i really don't care.
